- 🌱 Lately, I have been learning combinations, enumeratics, and cloud computing.
- 💞️ I recently completed the Google IT Certificate online.
- 🛠️ Right now, I am creating a typing speed game website and studying freeCodeCamp's course on Relational Database Certificate.
- 🗓️ After completing what I am working on, I plan to study Data Visualization and Scientific Computing with Python at freeCodeCamp.
