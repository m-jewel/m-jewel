## Hello, I'm Jewel!

ᯓᡣ𐭩 I am currently a student at the University of Saskatchewan, working towards Bachelor of Science in Computer Science.
ᯓᡣ𐭩 My friends call me insane because I like waking up very early in the morning. In my free time, I like to play video games and create notion page to min/max for said video games.
ᯓᡣ𐭩 Lately, I have been learning mathematics combinations and enumeratics, and cloud computing.
ᯓᡣ𐭩  I recently completed the Google IT Certificate online.
ᯓᡣ𐭩 Right now, I am creating a typing speed game website and studying freeCodeCamp's course on Relational Database Certificate.
ᯓᡣ𐭩 After completing what I am working on, I plan to study Data Visualization and Scientific Computing with Python at freeCodeCamp.
